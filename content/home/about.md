**Christian Zünd wants to know why we behave the way we do.**

I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Zurich. [My research](#projects) combines field and online experiments with data from large administrative databases and genetic repositories. My work has been [published](#featured) in Science and Nature Genetics and has recently received quite a bit of [media attention](/publication/cohn-2019).

#**I will be joining the University of Oxford as a Research Fellow at the Saïd Business School in 2020.**
