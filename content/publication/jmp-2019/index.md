abstract = "This paper demonstrates how corruption negatively impacts policy effectiveness in a program that is explicitly designed to prevent the embezzlement of money, Brazil's Bolsa Família program. By reconstructing the program's beneficiary selection algorithm, I can identify families that were randomly admitted or not admitted to the program and estimate its effectiveness in different years and municipalities. I then show that Bolsa Família's effect on school enrollment increases by a third after a municipality has been audited at random. Using a theoretical model, administrative data, and a field experiment with 6,998 registration centers, I find that local corruption increases the probability that families underreport their income when registering for Bolsa Família, making it harder to target the families that benefit most. Turning to alternative explanations, the results suggest that neither closer school attendance monitoring, higher data quality, changes in administrative processes, better infrastructure and funding, complementary social programs, tighter governance, nor increased whistle-blowing can explain the increase in Bolsa Família's effectiveness after a municipality has been audited at random."
